<h1>Ways that can solve the land rights issue is by knowing the cause of the problem so they would know what they need to do. For example, they need their properties to be more private for their community so the others that want to take the land will be punished if they enter private property or land. Another way is they can call a lawyer to protect their rights to their property so no one can get it because having a lawyer will prevent arguments for who is the owner of the land or properties.
  Establishing and enforcing important legal frameworks that protect and recognize the rights of all citizens, particularly marginalized groups and indigenous communities, is essential for addressing land rights issues.
  </h1>
<h2>One of the ways we can prevent the loss of land rights is by tackling one of the problems which is vandalism of private property. One of the ways we can prevent this is by helping and installing proper security for the private properties we can help prevent or at least lessen the problem of vandalism of the private properties. 
</h2>
<h3>Seeking official help from the law and getting proper lawyers to help you with your land rights case can also be a solution to the land rights problem because if you have a good compelling case to present you may be able to get your land rights back.
</h3>
<h4> issue of land rights is a complex and contentious one, and the best solution often depends on the specific circumstances and the interests of the various parties involved. Generally, a fair and effective solution to land rights issues requires a combination of legal, political, and social </h4>
